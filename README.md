# Cryptodog Web Client

A pure JavaScript client you can either run locally in your browser, or via our hosted service.

## Todo

* Remove superfluous browser-specific code.

    The obvious culprits have been deleted, but if you see something related to Chrome/Firefox/Mac, verify that it's redundant and remove it.

* Remove Facebook support.

    Mostly done. Language files and locale.js still contain references to FB, but these are opaque to the user.

* Update libs and corresponding code calls!

* Add semicolons to JS files.

* Use cookies for option storage instead of addon APIs.

* Add support for capital letters in nicknames.

    Need to make sure this doesn't mess up any XMPP stuff first.

* Change code and UI references from "cryptocat" to "cryptodog".

* Make dog logo.

* Add more emoticons.

* Convert cat facts to dog facts.
